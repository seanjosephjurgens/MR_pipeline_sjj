# MR_pipeline_sjj
A Mendelian Randomization (MR) pipeline that takes GWAS summary statistics and performs/uses both `TwoSampleMR` and `CAUSE` R-packages to output various MR results and associated diagnostic plots. The pipeline also takes genotype data as LD reference, and can perform pruning based on desired metrics. 

The pipeline was used in various publications:
```
Jurgens et al.  Genome-wide association study reveals mechanisms underlying dilated cardiomyopathy and myocardial resilience. Nature Genetics (accepted for publication).
Weng et al.  Common and rare variant contributions to bradyarrhythmia. Nature Genetics (accepted for publication).
